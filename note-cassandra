Cassandra keeps
- bloom filter and sampled index (the same name as index summary, I think) in
	memory. Keep these in hot storage for fast start.
- Index, which has keys and starting position of data, is not kept in memory.
	Keep in hot storage.
- Data files. Keep either hot or cold storage device depending on their
	temperatures.
- Show an example size of them.
